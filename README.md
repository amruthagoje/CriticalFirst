#CriticalFirst

Project Overview

CriticalFirst is a scalable, Firebase-powered patient queue and triage optimization system designed to manage high patient inflow in clinics and hospitals while ensuring accurate prioritization of critical cases.

The system leverages token-based queueing, rule-driven triage scoring, and real-time data synchronization to dynamically adapt to changing operational conditions such as patient surges and reduced staff availability.



Project Goals

Implement a priority-aware patient queue system

Ensure critical-condition patients are served first

Maintain queue stability during sudden load increases

Support staff shortage scenarios through adaptive scheduling

Provide an offline-first, fault-tolerant architecture


System Functionality

The build includes:

Patient registration with automatic token generation

Rule-based triage scoring using symptoms and urgency levels

Priority queue management with real-time updates

Dynamic queue reordering based on system mutations:

Mutation A: Patient volume doubling

Mutation B: 40% reduction in staff availability

Firebase Firestore for real-time, consistent state management

Offline data persistence with background synchronization


Design Rationale

Traditional clinical queue systems often rely on static ordering or manual triage, which becomes unreliable during peak loads.
CriticalFirst addresses this limitation by introducing a deterministic, data-driven triage mechanism that preserves prioritization correctness under stress conditions.

The project was built to model real-world healthcare constraints and demonstrate how cloud-native technologies can be applied to critical infrastructure systems.


Use Cases & Extensibility

This system can be adopted or extended for:

OPD and clinic queue digitization

Emergency triage simulations

Healthcare system prototyping

Academic and hackathon demonstrations

Future enhancements may include:

AI-assisted triage prediction models

Role-based dashboards for medical staff

Analytics and patient flow visualization

Integration with hospital information systems (HIS)
